# python-nlp - A container for doing NLP in Python
This container is built with Python 3.7 and spaCy together with the English models - en-core-web-sm, en-core-web-md, and en-core-web-lg. It is fairly minimal on its own but can be used as the basis of more sophisticated containers combining spaCy with Jupyter or with Flask.
